Speract-Activated Signaling Pathway network for sea urchin sperm

This is a set of routines which I used on my PhD to model the calcium oscillations that reorient the swimming of sperm
after detection of speract, an egg-derived peptide.

The model is based on the boolean approach that Stwart Kauffman introduced decades ago. Part of this software is
published in the journal [PLoS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022619). 
An [interactive applet](http://www.fis.unam.mx/research/seaurchin/discrete/) is also online.
Here's the [.jar file](http://www.fis.unam.mx/research/seaurchin/discrete/CalciumApplet.jar).

These routines include the construction of a network, based on logical rules.
 - Attractors finding
 - An interactive applet for looking at the network dynamics.
 - Depict of attractors landscapes
 - Conversion from binary to ternary or to decimal form.
 - Creation of histograms
 - correlations

We've bundled proper NetBeans environment. You can probably just open this project as a NetBeans project.
