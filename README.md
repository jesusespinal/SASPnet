Speract-Activated Signaling Pathway network for sea urchin sperm

This is a set of routines which I used on my PhD to model the calcium oscillations that reorient the swimming of sperm
after detection of speract, an egg-derived peptide.

The model is based on the boolean approach that Stwart Kauffman introduced decades ago. Part of this software is
published in the journal PLoS ONE.
These routines include the construction of a network, based on logical rules.
Attractors finding
An interactive applet for looking at the network dynamics.
Depict of attractors landscapes
Conversion from binary to ternary or to decimal form.
Creation of histograms
correlations
etc.
